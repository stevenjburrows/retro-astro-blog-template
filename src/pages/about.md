Welcome to this blog template by Steven aka the Kilted Coder

It's using Astro and Hashnode. You can [clone it on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenjburrows/retro-astro-blog-template) to use it for yourself, and see how it works! I would _love_ if you told me when you do use it, I love seeing variations on it!

This was based on [Cassidoo's template](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg) and her blogs are work reading [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co)

Enjoy!
